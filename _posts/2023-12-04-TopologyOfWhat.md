### Introduction to the Field

Topological materials are a rather recent development. Only 40 years ago was the first conception of how the [Quantum Hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hall_effect) worked by Thouless, Haldane, and other big names [1][thouless],[2][haldane]. They showed how some 2D materials can exhibit a quantized hall conductance.

Eventually, this phenomenon was attributed to something called the topological invariant.
