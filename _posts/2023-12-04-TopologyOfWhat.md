### Introduction to the Field

Topological materials are a rather recent development. Only 40 years ago did Thouless, Haldane, and other big names explain how the various [Quantum Hall effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Hall_effect) work [1][thouless],[2][haldane]. Thouless showed how some 2D materials can exhibit a quantized hall conductance in the presence of a magnetic field. Haldane then extended this to materials with strong enough spin-orbit coupling, an inherent property that mimics an applied magnetic field (known as the Quantum *Anamalous* Hall Effect). 

This discovery sparked a great deal of commotion in the world of condensed matter physics. 


## How do chemists understand topology?

As chemists, we are comfortable dealing with quantities (or qualities) that are not actually physical observables. Bonds and molecular charges certainly have no associated operator, yet we speak of them as if they are real. The topological invariant is no different. There is no way to measure the topology of a material, but we can observe its consequences. 

Non-trivial bulk topology in topological insulators produces distinct surface states. These states (either edge if the material is 2D or a surface if the material is 3D) span the entire bandwidth of the valence-conductance bandgap with a linear dispersion. These bands cross, often at a high symmetry point, forming something referred to as a [Dirac cone](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1947PhRv...71..622W/abstract).
