Even three years into my PhD, the concept of an electronic band is still not entirely clear to me. I attribute this to the unintuitive reciprocal space reference frame that bands are formulated in - yet all discussions center around the real space representation and consequences of (real space) system size.  

Bands are generally introduced from the viewpoint of molecular orbital theory, most likely due to the insightful paper ["How Chemistry and Physics Meet in the Solid State"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.198708461) by Prof. Roald Hoffmann.

Hoffmann opens with the comment

> Given the vitality and attractiveness of [solid state chemistry], I take some risk in listing some minor problems that I perceive at the interfaces of solid-state chemistry  with  physics and with the rest of chemistry.

In reference to the prevailing perception of chemistry during his time. Physicists believed chemistry to be a field that is strictly capable, or even singularly interested in, *local* phenomena; a mindset isolated to discrete molecules and the bonds that form them. He also admits that band theory isn't part of the standard chemistry curriculum - further exacerbating this perceived limitation. 

It could be argued that this perception is true and continues to be true. We as chemists understand band theory as a continuation of our discrete local interactions. 

To illustrate what that means, lets spend some time with trans-polyacetylene.

Trans-polyacetylene is a polymer made of repeating units of $C_2H_2$
